This basic calculator is made with dependancy math_expressions: ^2.1.0 so all the complex calculaton is avoided. A Custom button class is providing all buttons in it. It shows a example of implementing widget ccommunication specially the function- CallBack(). 

2. Body Mass Indicator(BMI) Calculator

This application is build with provider state management. UI and data communication is given more imporance than the accuracy of BMI. In calculating BMI age does not play any roll so the slider for age is given for designing purpose. The text controller has an important roll since the data from textfield is expected to be changed (through increase or decrease button) in real time when the user presses.

Neither male of femal has any effect of BMI rate, though the widget is made with male and female emoji and shows a good example of widget switching as user requires. 

3. Age guesser

This application is not responsive but it can guess the number between 1  to 31 by showing 6 different pages which contains different options. App consists of only two different pages. Each time instead of switching into a new page it keeps changing the sequence of number. So the code is more efficient. A good matrix system and complex calculation can be found in the backend.
